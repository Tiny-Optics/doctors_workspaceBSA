# Dropbox Refresh Token Fix

## Problem
The Dropbox integration was experiencing issues where after 24 hours, the system would require manual re-authorization instead of automatically refreshing tokens. This was causing the "automatic token refresh every ~4 hours" feature to fail.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `refreshAccessToken` method in `backend/internal/service/dropbox_service.go`. After a successful token refresh:

1. ✅ The database was correctly updated with the new access token
2. ✅ The database correctly preserved the refresh token (not overwriting it)
3. ❌ **The cached configuration was not reloaded from the database**
4. ❌ **Subsequent operations used the stale cached refresh token**

## The Fix
Added a call to `loadConfigFromDB()` after successful token refresh to ensure the cached configuration is synchronized with the database.

### Code Changes
In `backend/internal/service/dropbox_service.go`, after line 214:

```go
// Reload configuration from database to ensure cached config is in sync
// This is critical to prevent refresh token issues after 24+ hours
if err := s.loadConfigFromDB(ctx); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Warning: Failed to reload config after refresh: %v\n", err)
    // Don't return error here as the refresh was successful
    // The cached config will be updated on next operation
} else {
    fmt.Println("Successfully reloaded Dropbox config from database after token refresh")
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Initial Setup**: User authorizes Dropbox → refresh token stored in database
2. **Token Expiry**: After ~4 hours, access token expires
3. **Automatic Refresh**: Next Dropbox operation triggers `ensureValidToken()`
4. **Token Refresh**: System uses refresh token to get new access token
5. **Database Update**: New access token stored, refresh token preserved
6. **Cache Reload**: ✅ **NEW** - Cached config reloaded from database
7. **Continued Operations**: All subsequent operations use fresh tokens

## Testing
Added comprehensive tests in `backend/internal/service/dropbox_service_test.go`:

- `TestDropboxConfig_IsTokenExpired()` - Tests token expiry logic
- `TestDropboxConfig_NeedsReconnection()` - Tests reconnection logic  
- `TestDropboxConfig_GetPublicStatus()` - Tests security (no token exposure)

## Benefits
- ✅ **Fixes 24-hour re-authorization issue**
- ✅ **Maintains automatic token refresh**
- ✅ **Preserves refresh tokens indefinitely**
- ✅ **No breaking changes to existing functionality**
- ✅ **Added comprehensive test coverage**

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:

1. Set up Dropbox integration
2. Wait for access token to expire (or force refresh)
3. Perform Dropbox operations
4. Check logs for "Successfully reloaded Dropbox config from database after token refresh"
5. Verify operations continue working without manual re-authorization

The system should now maintain continuous Dropbox access without requiring manual re-authorization every 24 hours.
